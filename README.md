# Regression-Analysis
The repository is a compilation of a projects and scripts developed in the course Regression Analysis thaugh by the professor Mario Enrique Arrieta. I want to say that this course was one of the my favorite in my pre graduate education and I see in it the perfect combination between statistics and maths, I love the formalism in good applications.
